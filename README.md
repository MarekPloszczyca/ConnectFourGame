# ConnectFourGame
"Connect Four" is a game for two people that involves filling empty spaces on the board using two-colored tokens. Players move alternately, and each move is limited to a maximum of 30 seconds. The winner is the first person to arrange four tokens of the same color horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The application was created to be played by two people, but the user can choose to play against the computer, in which a simple algorithm imitates the opponent's movement. Algorithm is just for showcase and might be updated in the future to make games vs computer harder.<br/><br/><br/>![ConnectFour3](https://github.com/Marekplo/ConnectFourGame/assets/94579632/8e29315c-45d3-4377-a272-4faaa32be069)
